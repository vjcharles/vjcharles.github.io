You'll find mentions to various projects here. 

Check out the [dyn-text][dyn-text] for a little web component that turns a list of words or phrases into an inline slideshow. Now you can easily say the same thing a few ways and use the same text footprint.

[Feedify][feedify] lets you throw things into a directory and have them turned into an iTunes compatible podcast/rss feed.

[Shared Hosting Dynamic DNS][dynamic_dns_homespun] is a project to give all the tools and instructions on getting up your own dynamic dns service so you can access machines from anywhere that are behind a dynamic IP address. No need for a premium service when you can easily make your own.
