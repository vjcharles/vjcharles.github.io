Hello! Initially this site is to contain general info on github related projects and give an overview of past and current projects. If you notice regular posts, that means more general code-related posts are arriving here as well. It's not clear at this moment if this is *the* code blog, but maybe will be.

See [github.com/vjcharles](https://github.com/vjcharles) for a list of current public projects.
